## Main Idea

Google Keep but for game devs. The "notes" connect up to each other like levels in a level design (using a tree datastructure). 

The objective is to make your notes feel more like the game you're building so that it's more immersive and fun for the game developer.

I intend to use their own concept art and music depending on where they're currently taking notes and stuff like that.

## Impetus

I was watching someone build a game on twitch.tv and noticed that they were using msft word to jot down notes for their game. 
It gets the job done, but I thought it was a very hollow and bland application for taking notes in (especially considering the medium).
So I sought out to make an application that was much more animated, immersive and entertaining to use!
