## Main Idea

Google Keep for game developers except the notes are connected to each other using a tree/graph datastructure, where each note represents a level in a game.

The objective is to make your notes feel more like a game environment so that they're more fun for game developers.

It will also give them a better feel for what their game is like since I intend to play their music and concept art at relevant places

And to show their related concept art at each note.

Bring the game environment to the developer's notes themselves.

## Premise

This guy was editing a word document for his video game, and he had a header for each zone in his game.

## Opportunity

He had to keep scrolling up and down to move between different zones in his game. 

I think it would be more interesting if you could make it look more like a level design for a video game. 

I was thinking of creating a document editor, where you could create a bunch of blobs and then click on them

and they would blow up and have word processing stuff.

## Tech 

Tauri app in React.

Website hosting the app can be in Vue.

I'm thinking of using data structures knowledge by making each.

## Ideas

It would play the music you made for each part of the level when you're in that part of your docs

Desktop in React
Website equivalent in Angular
Landing page in Vue
